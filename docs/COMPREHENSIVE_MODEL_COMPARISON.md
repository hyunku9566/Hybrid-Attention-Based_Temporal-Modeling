## Architectural Analysis

### 1. Local Attention Hybrid 🥇
**Architecture:** TCN (5 blocks) → Local Self-Attention (window=25) → BiGRU → Global Attention

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Best temporal feature extraction:** TCN captures multi-scale patterns
- ✅ **Local attention efficiency:** Focuses on relevant windows without global overhead
- ✅ **Bidirectional context:** BiGRU captures forward/backward dependencies
- ✅ **Global aggregation:** Attention pools most important temporal features
- ✅ **Balanced complexity:** 3.32M params with excellent generalization

**Why it wins:**
- Combines strengths of all components synergistically
- Local attention (window=25) perfectly matches short ADL sequences (T=100)
- Residual connections + LayerNorm enable stable deep training
- Strong inductive bias for temporal structure

**Best for:**
- Short-to-medium length sequences (T=50-200)
- Multi-scale temporal patterns
- Activities with both local and global dependencies

---

### 2. Baseline (TCN-BiGRU-Attention) 🥈
**Architecture:** TCN (3 blocks) → BiGRU → Global Attention

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Excellent parameter efficiency:** 2.26M params (smallest)
- ✅ **Strong temporal inductive bias:** TCN + BiGRU combo works well
- ✅ **Fast inference:** Smaller model, faster predictions
- ✅ **Robust generalization:** Less prone to overfitting

**Why it's strong:**
- Simple architecture with proven components
- TCN dilation [1, 2, 4] matches short sequence structure
- BiGRU captures long-range dependencies without attention overhead
- Global attention provides interpretability

**Best for:**
- Production deployments (fast, small, reliable)
- Limited computational resources
- When parameter efficiency matters

---

### 3. Deep TCN 🥉
**Architecture:** Deep TCN (6 blocks) → SE Attention → Global Pooling

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Multi-scale feature collection:** Fuses blocks 2, 4, 6
- ✅ **Channel attention:** SE blocks help feature selection
- ✅ **Moderate parameters:** 2.43M (similar to baseline)

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ **Over-smoothing:** 6 blocks with dilation [1,2,4,8,16,32] may blur fine-grained patterns
- ⚠️ **Too much dilation:** Receptive field exceeds sequence length (T=100)
- ⚠️ **Loss of local details:** High dilation loses short-term dependencies

**Why it underperforms:**
- Excessive depth without recurrent connections
- Dilation [16, 32] sees beyond sequence boundaries
- Pure convolution lacks sequential modeling (no RNN/Attention)

**Could improve with:**
- Fewer blocks (4 instead of 6)
- Lower max dilation (8 instead of 32)
- Adding BiGRU or attention after TCN

---

### 4. Conformer
**Architecture:** Conformer blocks (FFN → MHSA → Conv → FFN) × 4

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Convolution + Attention fusion:** Best of both worlds in theory
- ✅ **Proven in speech:** State-of-art for ASR tasks

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ **Heavyweight:** 6.15M params (2.7× baseline)
- ⚠️ **Data hungry:** Needs more training samples
- ⚠️ **Attention overhead:** 4 multi-head attention layers overkill for T=100
- ⚠️ **Overfitting risk:** High capacity vs. limited data (7K samples)

**Why it underperforms:**
- Designed for long sequences (speech: T=500-2000)
- Multi-head attention (4 heads × 4 layers = 16 attention ops) too complex
- Positional encoding may not suit structured ADL patterns
- Insufficient data to justify model capacity

**Could improve with:**
- Smaller model (2 blocks, 2 heads)
- Pre-training on larger ADL datasets
- Task-specific attention mechanisms

---

### 5. Transformer
**Architecture:** 4-layer Transformer encoder with positional encoding

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **No temporal inductive bias:** Treats time as permutation-invariant
- ❌ **Short sequence curse:** T=100 too short for self-attention to learn patterns
- ❌ **Data inefficiency:** Requires 10-100× more data
- ❌ **Global attention waste:** Attends to all timesteps equally

**Why it fails:**
- Designed for NLP (sequences of discrete tokens, T>512)
- Positional encoding insufficient for continuous temporal dynamics
- Over-smoothing: 4 attention layers blur short activities
- No hierarchical feature extraction (needs CNN front-end)

**Could improve with:**
- CNN front-end for feature extraction
- Significantly more training data (50K+ samples)
- Temporal convolution between attention layers
- Or just use Conformer instead

## Validation Accuracy vs. Test Accuracy

| Model | Val Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Gap |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-----|
| Local Hybrid | 96.73% | 97.52% | +0.79%p |
| Baseline | ~95.4% | 95.40% | ~0.0%p |
| Deep TCN | 93.98% | 93.42% | -0.56%p |
| Conformer | 92.92% | 92.08% | -0.84%p |
| Transformer | ~84.0% | 83.66% | ~-0.34%p |

**Analysis:**
- **Local Hybrid:** Slight improvement on test set (excellent generalization)
- **Baseline:** Stable across val/test
- **Deep TCN, Conformer:** Small degradation (minor overfitting)
- **Transformer:** Consistent poor performance (underfitting, not overfitting)

## Training Efficiency

### Convergence Speed (Epochs to Best Validation)

| Model | Best Epoch | Early Stop | Total Time |
|-------|------------|------------|------------|
| Local Hybrid | ~30 | No | ~15 min |
| Baseline | 28 | No | ~12 min |
| Deep TCN | ~35 | No | ~13 min |
| Conformer | ~25 | No | ~18 min |
| Transformer | ~20 | Yes | ~15 min |

**Notes:**
- All models trained with patience=15
- Conformer slowest due to heavyweight architecture
- Transformer stopped early (poor convergence)

---

## Recommendations

### Best Overall Choice: **Local Attention Hybrid**
**Use when:**
- You need the highest accuracy possible
- Computational resources allow 3.3M params
- Short-to-medium sequences (T=50-200)
- Multi-scale temporal patterns exist

### Best Efficient Choice: **Baseline (TCN-BiGRU-Attention)**
**Use when:**
- Parameter efficiency is critical
- Fast inference required (production)
- Good balance of accuracy and speed
- Limited computational budget

### When to Use Others:
- **Deep TCN:** Tune with fewer blocks/lower dilation, or combine with RNN
- **Conformer:** Pre-train on larger datasets, or use for much longer sequences
- **Transformer:** Avoid for short sequences; use Conformer if attention is needed

## Hyperparameter Sensitivity

All models used identical hyperparameters:

```python
{
    "hidden_dim": 256,      # All models
    "dropout": 0.1,         # Optimal from baseline tuning
    "batch_size": 32,       # Optimal from baseline tuning
    "lr": 3e-4,             # AdamW learning rate
    "gamma": 1.5,           # Focal loss gamma
    "epochs": 50,           # Max epochs
    "patience": 15          # Early stopping
}
```

**Note:** Model-specific hyperparameters (e.g., attention window size, number of blocks) were kept at reasonable defaults. Further per-model tuning could improve results.

## Ablation Study Suggestions

To better understand Local Attention Hybrid's success:

1. **Remove local attention:** Compare TCN→BiGRU→GlobalAttn vs. full hybrid
2. **Vary window size:** Test window=[10, 15, 25, 50] for local attention
3. **Remove BiGRU:** Compare TCN→LocalAttn→GlobalAttn (no recurrence)
4. **Remove global attention:** Compare TCN→LocalAttn→BiGRU (no pooling)
5. **Simpler baseline:** Compare GRU-only, TCN-only

Expected result: Each component contributes to the 2.12%p improvement.
